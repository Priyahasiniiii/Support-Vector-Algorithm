# Support-Vector-Algorithm
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, but it is most commonly applied to classification problems. The primary goal of SVM is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in a high-dimensional space.
